Research & Learn

What are the main Agile ceremonies and their purpose?

Daily Stand-ups
A short meeting held every day where team members share what they completed yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any blockers. It keeps everyone aligned and helps identify issues early.

Sprint Planning (Scrum)
Held at the beginning of each sprint. The team discusses priorities, selects tasks for the sprint, estimates effort, and clarifies requirements. It ensures everyone understands what will be delivered.

Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)
Instead of sprint planning, Kanban uses continuous reprioritization. Tasks are pulled based on priority and capacity. Work flows continuously without fixed sprint cycles.

Retrospectives
A meeting at the end of a sprint (or regularly for Kanban teams) to discuss what went well, what did not, and what improvements can be made. It drives continuous improvement.

Backlog Refinement
An ongoing process where the product backlog is reviewed, updated, and clarified. Tasks are broken down, sized, and re-prioritized to ensure the backlog remains organized and ready for upcoming work.

How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?

Agile teams collaborate using communication and project management tools such as Slack, Jira, GitHub, and Trello. Teams share updates in writing, use detailed documentation, and record videos for explanations. Overlapping working hours are used for essential discussions. Clear task descriptions, acceptance criteria, and written updates help ensure progress even when team members are not online at the same time.

Reflection

How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

Agile ceremonies provide structured opportunities for the team to communicate about progress, challenges, and priorities. They help reduce confusion, keep everyone aligned, and make sure the team is moving toward shared goals. Regular touchpoints prevent misunderstandings and support transparency.

Which ceremony is most important for your role, and why?

The most important ceremony for my role is the Daily Stand-up. It provides quick visibility into the team's work, makes it easy to identify blockers, and keeps me aligned with the team’s priorities each day. It is short but has a strong impact on communication and coordination.

Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.

Observation: Team members shared their progress, upcoming tasks, and blockers. The meeting was brief and stayed focused on essential updates.

Document one change to improve team collaboration.

Change: I can improve team collaboration by providing more detailed written updates so teammates in other time zones can follow my progress without needing real-time meetings.
