# Research & Learn

# What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?

# Developers
Developers write code, build features, fix bugs, and collaborate on technical decisions. They ensure the product is functional, maintainable, and aligned with requirements.

# QA (Quality Assurance)
QA engineers test the product to confirm that features work as expected. They create test plans, perform manual or automated tests, report bugs, and verify fixes.

# Product Manager (PM)
The Product Manager defines the product vision, writes user stories, prioritises the backlog, and aligns the team with business goals. They ensure the team works on what brings the most value.

# Agile Project Manager (Agile PM) or Scrum Master
They facilitate Agile ceremonies, remove obstacles, track progress, and ensure the team follows Agile principles. Their focus is on improving team workflow and communication.

# Supporting Roles (Stakeholders, UX Designers, Customer Support, etc.)
Supporting roles provide context and feedback:

- UX designers create wireframes and ensure a good user experience.

- Stakeholders give business and customer requirements.

- Customer support shares real user pain points.

Each role helps shape the direction and quality of the product.

# How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?

Scrum
In Scrum, collaboration happens through structured ceremonies. The PM prepares the sprint backlog, developers and QA work together to complete tasks, and the Scrum Master supports the team's process. Work is delivered in fixed sprint cycles.

Kanban
In Kanban, collaboration is more continuous. Work moves smoothly through stages on a Kanban board. Developers pick tasks based on priority and capacity, QA tests completed work, and the PM continuously reprioritises. The Agile PM monitors workflow efficiency and helps remove bottlenecks.

# How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

As a frontend developer, I will be working closely with:

- UX designers to implement layouts and improve user experience

- Product Managers to clarify acceptance criteria and understand user needs

- Backend developers to integrate APIs and ensure data flows correctly

- QA engineers to resolve bugs and polish the user interface

This collaboration ensures the product works correctly, looks good, and meets business goals.

# Tasks

# What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

My role is Frontend Developer. I will be contributing to the Agile process by building and improving user interfaces, implementing designs, and ensuring that the frontend is responsive, accessible, and aligned with product requirements. I will provide regular updates, collaborate with designers and backend teams, and help move tasks smoothly across the board from development to completion after completing the onBoarding process.

# Identify one role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.

Since for now I am doing the onboarding process I am working all alone and jump on Daily standups if i require any help or put up questions in discord. But after the onboarding process I feel i will be working with UX designers to actually implement their design or i will be mainly helping to fix issues and help the app to be a better version.
